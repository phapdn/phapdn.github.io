I received the Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Inha University, South Korea, in 2022. Subsequently, I held a post-doctoral fellowship at the Artificial Intelligence System-on-Chip (AI-SoC) Research Center, Inha University, Incheon, South Korea, from September 2022 to January 2024.

Currently, I am a lecturer/researcher in Vietnam-Korea University of Information and Communication Technology (VKU), a part of The University of Danang (UDN), located in Danang, 55000, Vietnam.
