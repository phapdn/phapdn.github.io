I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the Artificial Intelligence System-on-Chip (AI-SoC) Research Center and [Digital Integrated Systems Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/inhasoc), [Inha University](https://eng.inha.ac.kr/eng/index.do), Korea and a lecturer of [Vietnam-Korea University of Information and Communication Technology](https://vku.udn.vn/), [The University of Danang](https://www.udn.vn/english), Vietnam. I received the B.S. degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering from the Danang University of Science and Technology in 2009, the M.S. degree in Electronic Engineering from The University of Danang, Vietnam, in 2015 and the Ph.D. degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Inha University, Korea, in 2022.

My primary research interests include algorithms and architectures for post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption. Moreover, I am interesting in the implementation of machine learning algorithms on edge devices and embedded systems.
